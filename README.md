# n-body-simulator
Models a(n arbitrarily complex) system of objects acting under the force of gravity

NOTE: The .py file uses the package tkinter, which is currently buggy. In fact, the tkinter functions that the simulator uses crash my computer. Attempting to run this program is not advised at present.

This program was designed for personal use, so documentation is still in the works.
Drawing capabilities are not yet completely implemented.
